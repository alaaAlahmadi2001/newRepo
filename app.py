### Hey there!

#### I'm Alaa, a recent graduate in computer science and a data science professional. 
#### I'm on the hunt for a job that matches my qualifications and, at the same time, will set me on the path to becoming a wealthy twentysomething ðŸ’°.

#### Since I'm passionate about data science, I thought I'd take a creative approach to job hunting.  
#### You might be wondering, How, Alaa? 
#### Let me tell you ðŸ’¡!!.

#### First, I searched for reliable data on job postings in Saudi Arabia.
#### Once I found the data, I made sure it included all the information I needed, and I started cleaning and analyzing it until it was perfect. 
#### It didnâ€™t take me long; as I said, Iâ€™m a proâ€”just waiting for my chance to shine.

#### As a data scientist, I know that visualizations ðŸ“Š are everything. 
#### They're not just for non-tech people; even for us "ðŸŒ professional data scientistsðŸŒ " they help us see the big picture and make better decisions.


#### So, I started organizing my thoughts into questions that I could answer with the data:

""")

    "__Select a question to see the visualization.__",

        "What proportion of job postings is attributed to each region within the kingdom?", 

        "Is there a gender preference indicated in the job postings?", 

        "What is the expected salary range for fresh graduates?", 

        "Are job opportunities predominantly targeted at individuals with experience, or is there room for fresh graduates as well?"
    )
)


if option == "What proportion of job postings is attributed to each region within the kingdom?":

    "__Riyadh has the highest job postings, followed by Makkah and the Eastern Region, with the remaining regions showing significantly fewer opportunities.__"
